# DeepKLM-light

This is a light version for [DeepKLM](https://github.com/gyulukeyi/DeepKLM). It focuses on getting you the surprisals via a BERT model for your data (which should be organized as like `input.txt`).

For the detailed explanation, please visit the DeepKLM repo. The paper (which is available only in Korean) is also accessible via [KCI](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002688747).
